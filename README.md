## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 🛡️ Phishing-Website-Detection
**Type:**  Machine Learning Project
**Technologies:**  Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, UCI Dataset
**Description:**  A machine learning project focused on the automatic detection of phishing websites using classification models. The "Phishing Websites" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used to train and evaluate various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. The workflow involved data preprocessing, model training and optimization, and performance evaluation using metrics such as F1-score and ROC AUC. Ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting demonstrated a strong balance between accuracy and training time, making them suitable for practical phishing detection tasks.

### 🏘️ UK-Housing-Price-Prediction
**Type:** Big Data Project
**Technologies:** Python, PySpark, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Dataproc, Kaggle
**Description:** A real-world regression project aimed at predicting housing prices in the UK based on historical transaction data. Using the publicly available UK House Prices Paid dataset, a full data processing pipeline was built, including cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis. Three ML models were implemented: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTRegressor). Although K-Nearest Neighbors was also considered, technical limitations with PySpark prevented successful integration.
The models were trained and evaluated both locally and in distributed environments using GCP’s Dataproc service, showcasing scalable machine learning on large datasets. Performance was measured with R² and RMSE. A comparative analysis with recent academic studies revealed the gap between controlled research results and real-world implementation, emphasizing the need for richer data, better feature engineering, and more sophisticated modeling for improved accuracy.
